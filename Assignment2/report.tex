Figure \ref{fig:demo_classification} is the provided demo of the make classification function. This function makes a random decision plane and uses that to make data points on both sides of the boundary. The figure makes a data set with values of $d=2,n=100,\text{ and } u=10$

The figure shows the too different classes of data $(-1,1)$. It will also make the data into two different sets of data. The first is the training set that is 70\% of the data these points are represent as the normal points of each of the classes. The second is the test set where the data is marked with circles around the points. The decision boundary shown in the figure as a dotted line represents the vector $a$ that was used to generate the classes for the uniformly distributed data points.
